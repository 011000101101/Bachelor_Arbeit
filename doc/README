How to build documentation
--------------------------

The VTR documentaion is generated using sphinx, a python based documenation generator.

The documentation itself is written in re-structured text (files ending in .rst), which
is a lightwieght mark-up language for text documents.

Currently VTR's documenation is automatically built by www.readthedocs.org and is served at:

    https://vtr.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

To build the documentation locally you need sphinx installed.

For ubuntu/debian based systems:

    apt-get install python-sphinx

To properly build citations and the bibliography, we use the sphinxcontrib-bibtex extension:

    pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex

Documentation Layout
-------------------

The root of the VTR documentation is the index.rst file in the current directory.

This file references other files using the toctree directive.

Key sub-systems of VTR have their documentation located in a sub-directy (e.g. vpr, arch), with thier own index.rst.
