/**
 * The 'TimingTags' class represents a collection of timing tags (see the 'TimingTag' class)
 * that belong to a particular node in the timing graph.
 *
 * Any operations performed using this task generally consider *all* associated tags.
 * For example, preforming a max_arr() call will apply the max accross all tags with matching
 * clock domain.  If no matching tag is found, the tag will be added to the set of tags.
 *
 * Implementation
 * ====================
 * Nominally the set of tags is implemented as a singly linked list, since each node in the timing graph
 * typically has only a handful (usually << 10) tags this linear search is not too painful.
