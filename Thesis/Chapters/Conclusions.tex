In this thesis, we implemented in-placement wirelength estimation using \glspl{NN} by modifying the open \gls{VPR} project. We investigated the feasibility of this approach by evaluating our modified versions of the \gls{VPR} Placer against the unchanged reference system. We detailed our approach and design choices, as well as our concrete implementation.

The evaluation showed that the \gls{CNN} version yields more consistent results than the \gls{RNN} version and both have the potential to outperform the reference system. 

We then discussed our results, mentioning possible problems and outlining future work. Finally, we concluded that \gls{NN} based in-\linebreak\noindent placement wirelength estimation is a promising concept, and our results encourage further research into this topic.
