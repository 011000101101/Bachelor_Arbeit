In this thesis we implemented in-placement wirelength estimation using \glspl{NN} by modifying the open \gls{VPR} project. We also investigated the feasibility of this approach by evaluating our modified versions of the \gls{VPR} Placer against the unchanged reference system. We detailed our approach and design choices, as well as our concrete implementation.

The evaluation showed that... TODO

We finally discussed our results, mentioning possible problems and outlining future work.
