Overview
========
VTR uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) as it's build system.
CMake provides a protable cross-platform build systems with many useful features.

For unix-like systems we provide a wrapper Makefile which supports the traditional `make` and `make clean` commands, but calls CMake behind the scenes.

Building using the Makefile wrapper
==========================
Run `make` from the root of the VTR source tree

```shell
#In the VTR root
$ make
...
[100%] Built target vpr
```

Specifying the build type
-------------------------
You can specify the build type by passing the `BUILD_TYPE` parameter.

For instance to create a debug build (no optimization and debug symbols):

```shell
#In the VTR root
$ make BUILD_TYPE=debug
...
[100%] Built target vpr
```

Passing parameters to CMake
---------------------------
You can also pass parameters to CMake.

For instance to set the CMake configuration variable `VTR_ENABLE_SANITIZE` on:

```shell
#In the VTR root
$ make CMAKE_PARAMS="-DVTR_ENABLE_SANITIZE=ON"
...
[100%] Built target vpr
```

Both the `BUILD_TYPE` and `CMAKE_PARAMS` can be specified concurrently:
```shell
#In the VTR root
$ make BUILD_TYPE=debug CMAKE_PARAMS="-DVTR_ENABLE_SANITIZE=ON"
...
[100%] Built target vpr
```


Using CMake directly
====================
You can also use cmake directly.

First create a build directory under the VTR root:

```shell
#In the VTR root
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

#Call cmake pointing to the directory containing the root CMakeLists.txt
$ cmake ..

#Build
$ make
```

Changing configuration on the command line
------------------------------------------------
You can change the CMake configuration by passing command line parameters.

For instance to set the configuration to debug:

```shell
#In the build directory
$ cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug

#Re-build
$ make
```

Changing configuration interactively with ccmake
------------------------------------------------
You can also use `ccmake` to to modify the build configuration.

```shell
#From the build directory
$ ccmake . #Make some configuration change

#Build
$ make
```

Non-unix-like platforms
=======================
CMake supports a variety of operating systems and can generate project files for a variety of build systems and IDEs.
While VTR is developed primarily on Linux, it should be possible to build on different platforms (your milage may varry).
See cmake.org for more details about using cmake and generating project files on other platforms.
