not able to compile under windows:
- VS fails due to unsupported CMake syntax (after installing missing packages
- cygwin gcc/g++ fails due to bug in compiler: 
-> compiling under linux works

bb coordinates notjust block coordinates leading to segfault because invalid array access:
/* Code below counts IO blocks as being within the 1..grid.width()-2, 1..grid.height()-2 clb array. *
		 * This is because channels do not go out of the 0..grid.width()-2, 0..grid.height()-2 range, and   *
		 * I always take all channels impinging on the bounding box to be within   *
		 * that bounding box.  Hence, this "movement" of IO blocks does not affect *
		 * the which channels are included within the bounding box, and it         *
		 * simplifies the code a lot.                                              */

using trained model in C++ requires tensorflow c-api
	-> precompiled api not working due to missing entry point in dll
		- verified this using dependency walker
		-> try to compile tensorflow from source
			- requires bezel build system 
				-> installed bezel
					-requires MSVC 2015
						->try to install
							->failed, skip for now
				- bezel 2.2.0 not compatible, requires downgrade
				-> deinstall bezel 2.2.0 and install bezel 2.0.0
			- bezel build fails because "patch" is not installed
				-> download installer and install from gnu patch project site
					-> bezel fails due to access denied on patch
					- manually running "patch" requires admin
						-> download "patch" source, configure, build
			-> patch working, but bezel fails due to missing MSVC (Visual C++ Build Tools)
				- installation fails because 2015-2019 version already installed and incompatible to 2015 version
					- uninstall 2015-2019 version and install 1015 version
					-> bazel build still fails with"requires Visual C++ build tools"
						-> restart PC...
						- still missing build tools, but slightly different error message
						-> installing "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019 "
							-> waiting... (3.38GB download)
			- starting to compile
			-> fails after a few minutes: C++ compilation of rule ... failed (error C2061: syntax error: identifier 'Kind')
				- similar problem found on stackexchange -> ried to install newest VS redistributable
				- already installed
				-> "repair installation"
				- still same error
					-> remove VS 2015 and VS 2017 packages from VS installation to force usage of VS 2019
			-> new error: ERROR: Action failed to execute: java.io.IOException: ERROR: src/main/native/windows/process.cc(199): CreateProcessW("C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin\amd64\cl.exe" [...] : The system cannot find the file specified.
				-> copy that executable from the VS bin path to the required path
				-> new error: Cannot open include file: 'stdint.h': No such file or directory
					-> also copy over include direcory (and lib and crt while we're at it)
